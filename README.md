# Mac OS Monterey Web

This open source project aims to replicate some of the Mac OS(Monterey, at the time of writing)'s desktop experience on web, using Svelte!

ðŸ”—ðŸ”— [macos.now.sh](https://macos.now.sh)

# Why

I've always been very fascinated with macOS, and have never owned a Mac/book. So I'm making the most beautiful aspect of macOS, its desktop, myself. For web. Inspired from [WinXP](https://winxp.now.sh/).

# Stack

- Framework - Svelte (Earlier Preact)
- Bundler - Vite, for super fast development.
- Component Library - None!!
- Styling Solution - SCSS.
